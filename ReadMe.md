### Notes:
- review the use of Projects
  - try using Asks, but pause this process whilst becoming familiar with MyG...
    - ...
      -
    - ... to Transform the information
      - should this become a PR?
        - some of the new Agents could be helpful
          - build a Proof of Concept. initially within Private pages.
            - making use of the COPY blocks
  - resume testing now that Es is making sliceAndDice progress
    - ensure the needed links are readily accessible
      - likely via TwH - for at least a bit of a securityDelay
      - consider the alternatives

  - KfwT v. TA
    - this needs to progress

- heatMapOrder is self-adjusting
  - perhaps using another repo will improve control
    - a separate ...Tp file might be more useful
  - AsksH about generis heatMap build capabilities in Market ConText(s)

- the postingGap due to 2025-01/travelNeeds
  - ...

- linkDeeper to headings from TwH
  - ...
 
- autoIndentation
  - needed testing - seemed to FAIL

  
### EdD should benefit from more publication

- ... particularly the LaLo and Mws performance resolutions 
  - that are the bulk of Lz/Es efforts


## Performance bundles
- test the Authentication work
  - expanded use may benefit

- spawn the SqLite work
  - TA is asking to negotiate hourly rate rather than fixed price.
    - discuss this with Lz
      - we will enhance our SoWs to reduce "uncertainty".
        - That will also help us measure relativeValue from among our contractors
          - BetterSow:
            - add Eric's explanation
            - ...
            - note that Scope of a SAow can be increased when more work is needed
  - anticipate the need for more Guidance via a SoW
    - can a new repo help?  ( especially gived the CoPilot PR support )
      - at the least this may stimluate learningForBpH
        - integrate the notes from the other repo
  - assume SJ may become an EdD component
    - confirm that the boast reporting tools will halp
      - there should be more detailed instructions for setup


## AsksLsH
  - Shared AsksH may be effective within LzH
    - plan for this
      - collect GitHub notes into a ConText that can then be used in AsksH
        - Privacy may require the use of offLine ( local) ) tools
          - evaluate the use of CoPilot in these ConText(s)
            - ask Prw if we have Enterprise access
              - if not, ask Dpl if we should
                - CoPilot will then work in Private repos
                  - confirm that with boost
            - at the very least this is EdD - and educational
              - Enumerate the UnCertainties
                - this should also be a boost talk that I am well prepared for
                  - try using their GitHub or Jira interface(s)


## ArchitectureRole
- "architecture" chat should follow OnTheList needs
  - accept "inevitably needed", but must be SoWed
    - this will inevitably be impacted by healthIssues
      - try to determine the potential extent of delays
        - focus on other needed aspects
    - the relationship will naturally become Advisory - not Supportive

- review my GISTs. looking for hints re
  - howTo merge a file into 2 more more files even in different repos
    - AsksH should be used liberally

- Show how to delete the false ReadMe file.
  - does it first need to be created to be deleted?
    - done yet ?
