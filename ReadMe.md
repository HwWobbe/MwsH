- spawn the SqLite work
  - anticipate the need for more Guidance via a SoW
    - can a new repo help?  ( especially gived the CoPilot PR support )
      - at the least this may stimluate learningForBpH
        - integrate the notes from the other repo
       
  - Shared AsksH may be effective within LzH
    - plan for this
      - collect GitHub notes into a ConText that can then be used in AsksH
        - Privacy may require the use of offLine ( local) ) tools
          - evaluate the use of CoPilot in these ConText(s)
            - ask Prw if we have Enterprise access
              - if not, ask Dpl if we should
                - CoPilot will then work in Private repos
                  - confirm that with boost
            - at the very least this is EdD - and educational
              - Enumerate the UnCertainties
                - this should also be a boost talk that I am well prepared for
                  - try using their GitHub or Jira interface(s)

- "architecture" chat should follow OnTheList needs
  - accept "inevitably needed", but must be SoWed
    - this will inevitably be impacted by healthIssues
      - try to determine the potential extent of delays
        - focus on other needed aspects
    - the relationship will naturally become Advisory - not Supportive

- review my GISTs. looking for hints re
  - howTo merge a file into 2 more more files even in different repos
    - AsksH should be used liberally

- Show how to delete the false ReadMe file.
  - does it first need to be created to be deleted?
